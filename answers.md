`QUESTION 4`

*How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?*

`ANSWER 4`

**With the little experience that I have with working in the production environment, performance issues begin to surface when the traffic is becoming very high and this point in time it important to take note of the memory consumption of the software and also to take note of how much time it take queries to the database to execute.**

**Knowing all these, it is important to carry out code reviews to optimise functions, classes and database queries and most importantly implement load balancing to help manage traffic efficiently.**
